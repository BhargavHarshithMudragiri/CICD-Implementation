#Installing Docker on Ubuntu 24.04

sudo apt update
sudo apt update docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker

#Executing Docker without sudo
By default, the docker command can only be run the root user or by a user in the docker group, which is automatically created during Docker’s installation process. If you attempt to run the docker command without prefixing it with sudo or without being in the docker group, you’ll get an error
If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group

sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in, or type the following:

su - ${USER}

You will be prompted to enter your user’s password to continue.
Confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:

groups

If you need to add a user to the docker group that you’re not logged in as, declare that username explicitly using:
sudo usermod -aG docker username
