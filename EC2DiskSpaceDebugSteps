When you come across an issue as "No Space left on device" in your EC2 instance while running a project locally then you need to follow below steps to fix it.
This issue requires you to resize the EBS Volume and Filesystem associated with it.
How to do it ? Lets look into it...

Step1: Verify the current disc usage of root directory(/) in linux machine.
command: df -h

Step2: Typically AWS gives you 8 GB standard storage volume when you launch EC2 instance. We need to increase this volume by going into EC2 instance volumes and modify it to 30GB
       Once the volume state is modified and status shows InUse, you need to run few commands to resize the root filesystem(/dev/root).

Step3: To check the updated EBS volume in linux instance, use below command. This command helps you in understanding the availble volume blocks Ex: xvda
command: lsblk

Result of above command is as below:
Name       Size   Type   Mountpoints
xvda       30G    disk   
 - xvda1   7G     part   /        
 - xvda16  913M   part   /boot

If you observe above result, volume disk is updated to 30G where as partition mounted to root (/) is still not updated. So we need to grow the size of xvda1 partition to as much as disk size.

3 Simple Steps to resize the filesystem.

step1: Install Cloud Guest utils
command: sudo apt-get install cloud-guest-utils

step2: Grow Partition
command: sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1

step3: Resize the filesystem with growed partition block
command: sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

Now verify if your filesystem is updated with volume size by using command df -h
